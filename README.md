# pymplectic
pymplectic is a python software that can solve hamiltonian problems separables in three parts.
## Getting Started
You can download this software with the next order:
```
git clone https://github.com/cosmogat/pymplectic
```
and you can use the example program:
```
python execucio.py
```
This software uses two classes: Metode for define the symplectic method and Solucionador for solve the problem.
## Solucionador class
This class needs a method (Metode object), a map for evolve the initial conditions, an initializer for read the initial conditions and optionally other atributtes.
## Method class
Methods needs the kind of method and the kind of processed method.
